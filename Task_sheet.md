# Tasks


## Road Following Algorithm Development

- **Algorithmic Foundation:** The core of your task is to develop an algorithm that enables a simulated robot to follow a designated path. You may opt for various approaches such as sensor-based line following, computer vision techniques, or even basic AI algorithms.

- **Sensor Integration:** Utilize the simulated vision sensors in CoppeliaSim to detect the path.

- **Control Logic:** Develop the control logic that translates sensor input into motor commands.
This could involve simple steering mechanisms or more complex control systems like PID controllers.

- **Programming:** Write your algorithm in Python, ensuring it interfaces effectively with CoppeliaSim through the Remote API. Focus on writing clean, well-documented code for ease of understanding and modification.
Key Concepts and Approaches:

    - **Computer Vision:** Explore image processing techniques like color detection, edge detection, or even neural networks for more advanced implementations.

    - **Proportional Control:** For simpler paths, a proportional controller might suffice to adjust the robot's steering based on the deviation from the path.

    - **Debugging and Iteration:** Regularly test your algorithm in the simulation. Be prepared to iterate and debug based on the robotâ€™s performance.
